# employee-tracker-homework

Well, here we are again! This is the part of the program where the developer gives any future developers insight into how this assignment was put together, and again I'm at a loss... It would be a mistake to say that this assignment ever did get put together...

And I think there's a lesson to be had there...

I looked at the drudgery of building out a big seed file as the thing to take care of sooner than later, which in hindsight was a clear mistake. Perhaps if I were to be tasked with something like this in the future, I'd likely construct the tables, insert a column for each, then figure out how to get them interacting with each other.

Which brings me to my Command Line! I believe a minor rudimentary breakthrough has been achieved to keep my work in the files connected to my repos. Also, I'm loving while not fully grasping all these npm packages, and am looking forward to understanding them better! Better things ahead!

I built a pretty sizeable set of user prompts and lists and so on before ever seeing if anything was connected, so as I said before, start out with bare bones tables with anything to identify them, get them connected and on the same team, get them filled out with a bit more data, and then start playing with that data with a gang of queries and such...

So I guess my big blind spot is testing. I don't seem to know when to do it and when I do, I certainly don't know how to go about it... It's like that one part of my understanding is keeping the reast of my head from advancing in the escape room! It's clear I need to work hard on that.

As for a code snippet... if I had a shred of code that worked outside of MySQL I'd be happy to show it to... 

So one more on the chin before I get back on my feet, eh? 'Sokay... I'm not going anywhere...
